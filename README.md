# Fortune Cookie

## Requirements

- [x] DOM querying: query elements from the DOM as necessary to build a functioning application.
- [x] DOM manipulation: modify DOM elements as necessary to evolve both the content and style of page elements.
- [x] DOM insertion: create new DOM elements and insert them into the DOM to generate new page content.
- [x] Events: use events, such as onclick, to make the application functional and interactive.
- [x] Randomness: integrate an element of randomness into the application, because randomness is funness.
- [x] Data: integrate some representation of data into the application, using JavaScript arrays and objects to store it.
- [x] Ajax: use the Fetch API to retrieve data from a server and represent it within the application.
- [x] Your application should exceed the complexity of the class example, both functionally and visually, and your application should differ significantly from the class example (a Magic 8-Ball).
- [x] Make your application look professional and presentable. Use valid HTML and CSS to structure and style your application.
